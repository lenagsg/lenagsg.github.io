                        <p>The clothes are meshes that can be modelled
                            directly in Blender, or in another package
                            and then imported into Blender as an obj file.
                            Note that the mesh type is Clothing, which
                            is the default unless the mesh has been
                            declared to be a human. A simple method
                            to obtain a starting point modelling is
                            to duplicate part of the human mesh and
                            separate it from the human. However,
                            in this case the duplicated mesh will
                            still be a human. To change the mesh type,
                            press the toggle button Human. The status
                            is now changed into Clothing.</p>

                        <p>After loading the human, the next step is to
                            "glue" the clothes to the human, in order
                            that they will automatically fit the body
                            changes. To control this association,
                            MakeClothes uses vertex groups. Each clothing
                            vertex must belong to exactly one vertex group,
                            and a vertex group with the same name must
                            exist in the human mesh as well. Only human
                            vertices in the correct vertex group will be
                            considered when making clothes.</p>

                        <p>Vertex groups speed up the clothes-making process
                            by pruning the search tree, and can be used
                            to control the appearance of clothes as well.
                            However, assigning vertex groups can be quite
                            tedious, and in many cases it is sufficient
                            to let MakeClothes create vertex groups
                            automatically. This is done automatically
                            when a human mesh is loaded. If a clothing
                            mesh does not have any vertex groups, it is
                            also done automatically, when the MakeClothes
                            button is pressed.</p>
